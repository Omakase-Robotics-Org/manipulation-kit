"""Fail when consumers are handed a new commit under an unchanged version.

This package publishes no releases. Every consumer pins a COMMIT
(``manipulation-kit @ git+ssh://…@<sha>``) and ``project.version`` has read
``0.1.0`` since the first commit. That combination has one specific, silent
failure mode: a consumer moves its pin, runs ``pip install -e .``, and pip --
which compares VERSIONS, not commits -- answers "Requirement already
satisfied" and keeps the OLD kit installed. The install prints success. The
robot then dies at import time, in a checkout that looks up to date.

That is not hypothetical: on 2026-09-09 this repository's history was
rewritten (6655b2d -> ce802ad) and the modules were renamed with it. Three
repositories on d1-2 pulled the new pin, reinstalled "successfully", and came
up with ``ModuleNotFoundError: manipulation_kit.arms.d1`` and
``cannot import name 'assets'`` because pip had reinstalled nothing.

So: if a change alters what consumers IMPORT (anything under ``src/``) or what
they must install ALONGSIDE it (the dependency lists in ``pyproject.toml``),
``project.version`` has to move too. Nothing can make pip notice a commit; a
version that changes is the only thing pip reliably acts on.

Usage
-----
    python tools/check_version_bump.py [--base REF]

``--base`` defaults to the pull request's base branch in GitHub Actions
(``GITHUB_BASE_REF``), else the first parent of HEAD. On the initial commit
there is no base to compare against and the check SKIPS -- it is a diff gate,
not a policy on a lone commit.
